===What is Iwik?

An InstikiClone, keeping Instiki's simplicity of installation and running, but with a 
strong focus on stability and bugfreenes.

Step 1. Download

Step 2. Run "ruby iwik.rb"

Step 3. Chuckle... "There's no step three!" (TM)

You're now running a perfectly suitable wiki on port 2500 
that'll present you with one-step setup, followed by a textarea for the home page
on http://localhost:2500.

Iwik lowers the barriers of interest for when you might consider
using a wiki. It's so simple to get running that you'll find yourself
using it for anything -- taking notes, brainstorming, organizing a 
gathering.

===Instiki Features:
* Regular expression search: Find deep stuff really fast
* Revisions: Follow the changes on every page from birth. Rollback to an earlier rev
* Export to HTML or markup in a zip: Take the entire wiki with you home or for reference
* RSS feeds to track recently revised pages
* Multiple webs: Create separate wikis with their own namespace
* Password-protected webs: Keep it private
* Authors: Each revision is associated with an author, so you can see who changed what
* Categories: Organize your pages with categories
* Reference tracker: Which other pages are pointing to the current?
* Speed: Using Madelein[http://madeleine.sourceforge.net] for persistence (all pages are in memory)
* Three markup choices: Textile[http://www.textism.com/tools/textile] 
  (default / RedCloth[http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth]), 
  Markdown (BlueCloth[http://bluecloth.rubyforge.org]), and RDoc[http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc]
* Embedded webserver: Through WEBrick[http://www.webrick.org]
* Internationalization: Wiki words in any latin, greek, cyrillian, or armenian characters
* Color diffs: Track changes through revisions

===New Features:
* File Uploads: upload images and other multimedia files in your wiki
* Includes: Make a MenuBar page and include it in the pages you want. You just got a fully 
  customizable menubar for your wiki.

Make sure that you always launch Iwik from the same working directory, or specify the storage 
directory in runtime parameters, such as:
  iwik --storage ~/iwik/storage

===Command-line options:
* Run "iwik --help"

===History:
